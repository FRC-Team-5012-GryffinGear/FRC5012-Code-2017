/**
 * Class that represents an accumulator to create a "negative inertia" effect on
 * motors. Where positive inertia would cause the output to ramp up to the
 * target value, Negative inertia will mimic a control loop's overshooting to
 * help make certain mechanisms more controllable. This is essentially a
 * software-configurable motor controller "brake" Useful for mechanisms that
 * tend to coast to a stop and this behavior is not acceptable.
